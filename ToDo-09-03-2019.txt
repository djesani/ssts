Items:
1. UX polish up (potentially remove top grid)
2. Publish date logic - use end date to determine if event should still show as today
3. Menu for mobile
4. When less than 4 grid on future grid, hide no future events (in UI - use class no-event)
5. Gallery change black background to same as events container
6. Admin section:
    UI:
        first view: username/password
        second view: all events in grid - update/(unpublish/publish toggle) buttons
        "create new" view: show a form with all fields needed for json file
    Server: Expose admin endpoints
