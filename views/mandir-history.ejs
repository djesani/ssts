        <h1>'Our temple'</h1>
        <h1>Mandir History</h1>
        <p>Jai Shree Swaminarayan,</p>
        <p>From the dawn of the millennium in the year 2000; members of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya began migrating to
          Sydney to better their lives, to make Australia their home and of course to promote the glory and message of
          Lord Shree Swaminarayan.<br>
          Just as our forefathers were pioneers who migrated abroad for a better life, there is a large flow of
          devotees coming to Sydney, Australia. His Holiness Acharya Maharajshree and Bhuj Saints have stated in their
          past speeches that they want to see the Swaminarayan Sampradaya grow and prosper throughout the world.<br>
          Followers migrate all over the world for many reasons, but the one valuable item they take with them is
          SATSANG. Without Satsang a person can degenerate, but with Satsang a person can flourish and become stronger.
          By associating with Saints and visiting our temples, devotees can enhance their knowledge of our religion.<br>
          Saints of Bhuj Mandir have written letters to the congregations of Temples throughout the world, guiding them
          to remain within the wishes and teachings of Lord Shree Swaminarayan.<br>
          With such guidance and words of wisdom of Lord Shree Swaminarayan and with the divine blessings from His
          Holiness Acharya Maharajshri and the Saints of Shree Swaminarayan Mandir, Bhuj Kutch; devotees first arrived
          in Sydney in 1999. As per the guidelines of our Sampraday, all the devotees performed Daily Aarti, Thaal,
          Katha, Varta, Kirtan, Dhun and Chesta at each other’s residences. After a while a collective satsang-sabha
          was being held every Sunday at devotee’s residences.<br>
          With the growth of our congregation we felt that more development was needed and decided to seek guidance
          from the Late Pujya Mahant Swami Shri Hariswarupdasji of Bhuj Mandir to register a temple under Shree
          Nar-Narayan Dev, Bhuj. Respecting the wishes of Mahant Swami a constitution adopting the laws and the
          regulations of this country and of our Sampradaya, was formed and was sent to Bhuj Mandir for approval. Thus
          respecting the orders given by Pujya Mahant Swami, “Shree Swaminarayan Temple Sydney Inc. (Under Shree
          Nar-Narayan Dev, Bhuj Kutch)”, was then registered as a non-profit making organisation in the Australian
          Business register.<br>
          The Sabhas being held at the residences of fellow devotees, were becoming overcrowded and therefore to cope
          with the increasing population, it was decided to hold Satsang Sabhas in a hired hall every Sunday, with
          Thakarthali and Rasotsav, being held on the last Sunday of every month. Other utsavs like Ramnavmi,
          Janmasthmi, Vasant Panchmi, Shiv Ratri, Hindola, Diwali, Ankoot and other prominent festivals are celebrated
          with great pomp and passion.<br>
          With the increasing population of devotees the committee made a request to Bhuj Mandir to commence a routine
          schedule of Saints to fly to Australia to spread the divinity of Lord Shree Swaminarayan and provide their
          Spiritual guidance to the devotees residing in this southern hemisphere of the World. Thus respecting and
          honouring the pleas of the devotees, the Saints of Bhuj Mandir agreed to commence a routine group of Saints
          to annually visit Australia (Sydney, Brisbane, Newcastle, Melbourne, Adelaide & Perth) and Singapore. With
          the grace of Lord Shree Swaminarayan the first Group of Saints of Bhuj Mandir arrived in Sydney for the first
          time ever in 2004.<br>
          This Group consisted of Saints of great calibre in all aspects of Satsang. We were graced with the presence
          of Upmahant Sadguru Purani Swami Dharmanandandasji, Sadguru Purani Swami ShriHaridasji, Shastri Swami
          Devcharandasji and Shastri Swami Bhaktvatsaldasji. With the presence of such Saints, Satsang Sabhas were held
          daily at various venues. The attendance of the younger generation at these Sabhas amazed the Saints. The
          Saints saw a divine vision of religious prosperity and established the very first overseas branch of the
          “Kutch Shree Nar-Narayan Dev Yuvak & Yuvika Mandal”. Since here forth we have been graced with visits by
          Saints of Bhuj Mandir every year.<br>
          With the requisition of the Saints, the committee began searching for suitable premises for establishing a
          Temple in Sydney. After considering various possibilities and options, the devotees all agreed to purchase
          land and build a Temple. After nearly a year of searching, a suitable piece of land had been put up for sale.
          The Trustees went to view this land and sought the guidance of Mahant Purani Swami Dharmanandandasji.
          Honouring the advice and assurance of Mahant Swami and with the divine blessings of Lord Shree Swaminarayan
          an offer was made and accepted. Shortly after contracts were exchanged. Plans are in progress to build a
          Temple on this land.</p>
