              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>Members of the Swaminarayan Sampraday started migrating to Sydney in the early 2000s, seeking better
                lives and to promote the glory of Lord Shree Swaminarayan. Guided by His Holiness Acharya Maharajshree
                and the Saints of Shree Swaminarayan Mandir – Bhuj, devotees brought with them the invaluable treasure
                of Satsang.</p>

              <h2>Temple History and Growth</h2>
              <p>In the year 2000, devotees began congregating in Sydney, performing daily rituals and sabhas in their
                homes. By 2001, guided and blessed by the Late Pujya Mahant Sadguru Purani Swami Hariswarupdasji of Bhuj
                Mandir, <em>Shree Swaminarayan Temple Sydney Inc. (Under Shree Nar-Narayan Dev, Bhuj Kutch)</em> was
                formally registered as a non-profit organisation. Weekly sabhas were held in hired halls in addition to
                regular festivals like Thakarthali and Raasotsav, and grand celebrations of Ramnavmi, Janmashtami, and
                Diwali.</p>
              <p>In 2003, the arrival of Upmahant Sadguru Purani Swami Dharmanandandasji, Sadguru Purani Swami Shri
                Haridasji, Shastri Swami Devcharandasji and Shastri Swami Bhaktvatsaldasji from Bhuj Mandir marked the
                establishment of the first overseas branch of the Shree Swaminarayan Yuvak Mandal, enhancing spiritual
                growth and community unity.</p>

              <h2>Temple Construction and Expansion</h2>
              <p>Following initial setbacks with the purchased land in 2006, a more suitable site was secured in 2012.
                Bhoomi Poojan was conducted on <strong>April 14, 2012</strong> in the esteemed presence of His Holiness
                Mota Maharajshree Tejendraprasadji Maharaj, Mahant Sadguru Purani Swami Dharmanandandasji Swami, Sadguru
                Purani Swami Keshavprasaddasji, and other prominent saints from Bhuj Mandir and Kalupur Mandir. The
                auspicious Khat Muhurat ceremony followed the next day.</p>
              <p>The temple construction was completed within nine months, culminating in its grand opening. On
                <strong>January 18, 2013</strong>, His Holiness 1008 Acharya Maharajshree Koshalendraprasadji presided
                over the Murti Pran Pratishtha ceremony together with Mahant Sadguru Purani Swami Dharmanandandasji
                Swami, Sadguru Purani Swami Keshavprasaddasji and other prominent saints from Bhuj Mandir &amp; Kalupur
                Mandir, officially welcoming the divine presence of Bhagwan to reside in Sydney.
              </p>
              <p>In 2018, significant renovations were undertaken, transforming the temple into a shikhar bandh
                structure adorned with a beautiful pink stone facade. These enhancements expanded both educational and
                community spaces, reinforcing the temple’s role as a spiritual and cultural hub.</p>

              <h2>Shree Swaminarayan Yuvak Mandal <span class="badge">SSYM Sydney</span></h2>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>At the turn of the new millennium, the late Mahant Sadguru Purani Swami Hariswarupdasji of Bhuj Mandir
                envisioned a group that would unite the youth of our religion globally. His goal was to empower the
                youth to move our satsang forward among their fellow haribhakto in this materialistic world. After years
                of dedicated effort, this vision was realised.</p>
              <p>Given the youthful congregation in Sydney, Australia, it was decided that this would be the ideal
                launch location of the international branch. In 2003, in the presence of esteemed Swamis from Bhuj,
                including the current Mahant Sadguru Purani Swami Dharmanandandasji, Shree Swaminarayan Yuvak Mandal
                Sydney was established.</p>
              <p>From humble beginnings—decorating hired halls for festivals—to organising the first Shibir in
                Australia, SSYM Sydney has thrived. Today, we offer activities designed to foster personal growth,
                community service, and spiritual development.</p>

              <h2>Ghanshyam Bal Mandal <span class="badge">GBM</span></h2>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>When Ghanshyam Maharaj took residence in Sydney in 2013, we committed to utilising our Mandir’s
                facilities to serve the new generation. Gujarati classes began at the end of 2013, soon followed by
                Dharmik classes. After the fifth anniversary, we unified activities under the Ghanshyam Bal Mandal
                brand. As of 2024, with <strong>210 students</strong> enrolled, GBM offers diverse programmes nurturing
                spiritual, cultural, and personal growth.</p>

              <h3>Ghanshyam Dharmik</h3>
              <p>Launched in 2014 using Bhuj Mandir materials, and refreshed in 2018 with interactive local workbooks
                and teacher resources. In 2022 we introduced the international <em>Svadhyay</em> syllabus (UK &amp;
                Australia contributions), focusing on self-improvement, Vedic study, and life skills for ages 6–16.</p>

              <h3>Ghanshyam Gujarati</h3>
              <p>Established in 2003 to instil Gujarati language and culture. Curriculum evolved from Willesden Mandir
                (1997) textbooks to modern, activity-based learning that preserves mother tongue and supports reading
                sacred shastras.</p>

              <h3>Ghanshyam Music</h3>
              <p>Since 2019, classes in tabla, keyboard, and singing nurture appreciation for Indian classical music and
                deepen connection to our Sampraday’s heritage.</p>

              <h3>Teaching Team</h3>

              <h2>Nilkanth Pipe Band and Lazium</h2>
              <p>Under SSYM, the Nilkanth Pipe Band and Lazium are vibrant symbols of cultural pride and musical
                excellence. Established in 2005 with drums and Lazium, the group grew alongside our congregation. During
                the 2012 construction phase, boys advanced from recorders to bagpipes, preparing for the 2013 Murti Pran
                Pratistha Mahotsav—the official launch of the Nilkanth Pipe Band.</p>
              <p>Today, the band features 18 bagpipe players, 6 snare drummers, 2 bass drummers, and 4 tenor drummers;
                over 100 boys and girls contribute to Lazium. The band performs at all major Mandir events, collaborates
                nationally, and performed at the 200-year anniversary of Bhuj Mandir in India in 2023.</p>
