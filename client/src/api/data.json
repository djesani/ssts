Tired from the harassment from Demon Mahishasoor, the Devtas requested Bhrahma, Vishnu and Shivji (Tridevs) to help them. Shaktimaa appeared from the Tridevs anger and fought with the demon continuously for 9 days. The demon was killed which signified the victory of Divine over the Evil and therefore we celebrate these 9 days by singing Mataji’s devotional songs with musical instruments. \n\nTo mark the Festival of Navratri – Shree Swaminarayan Temple, Sydney invites you to join the celebrations.\n\nDandiya & Raas Utsav will be held on Saturday 1st (from 7pm), Sunday 2nd (from 7pm), Saturday 8th (from 8pm) and Sunday 9th (from 7pm) October 2016.\n\nDandiya Sticks\nWe request you to bring your own dandiya sticks.

The Rath Yatra darshan will be available from 6.30am – 8.00pm and the aarti will be done at 7:00pm.\n\nRath Yatra originates from two words: “Rath” meaning chariot and “Yatra” meaning a pilgrimage or procession. The Rath Yatra Festival originated in Jaganaath Puri, Orissa (on the North Eastern coast of India) where it is still observed by the entire population today. The Rath Yatra Festival symbolises various stories of Lord Krishna’s travels on a chariot but the most popular one is the story of Jaganaath Puri. On this day, Shree Jaganaath (Shree Krishna) announced His wishes to visit His birthplace once every year. Therefore, every year the deities of Jaganaath Temple; Shree Jaganaath, His brother Balaram and His sister Subhadra, are traditionally installed on beautifully decorated chariots and pulled in a Yatra through the streets from Jaganaath Puri to Ghundicha Ghar. The journey is accompanied by thousands of devotees joyously singing and celebrating the Rath Yatra Festival.\n\nAlso on this day, Lord Krishna and Balaram left Gokul and travelled to Mathura. It was Shree Krishna’s maternal Uncle, the evil tyrant Kansa who had sent Akrur with a chariot to Gokul to invite Shree Krishna for a wrestling competition in Mathura. In conclusion, the Rath Yatra Festival depicts the many journeys of Shree Krishna on a chariot with His brother Balaram and His sister Subhadra. Jaganaath Temple is or was the only temple with these three murtis, therefore this festival is most celebrated there.",

On this day one should try and control the Antashatrus as in keep control of lust, anger, greed etc.  On this day people make mithay (sweets), feed grass to cows and carry out many good deeds. Feeding grass to a cow on this day yields huge amount of punyas (benediction), and any good deed carried out on this day is said to multiply its value by thousands, in the amount of punyas yielded. \n\nOn this day religion loving people make ladoos made of seseme seeds and jiggery, which are then donate to people who are less fortunate than them. If one is unable to carry out one of these good deeds on this auspicious day they can alternatively offer  donation (dhaan) to Shree Ghanshyam Maharaj.\n \nSankranti occurs in January, at which time the sky is clear and very bright. When looked at the sky  has the effect of soothing the mind. In order to encourage people to do darshan of this beautiful sky, a kite flying festival is held.  Kites of all different colours are flown by people from all different walks of life.\nOn this day we should pray to Maharaj that so that our kite (life) does not waiver, we have given the kite string to Him to hold and guide.",
